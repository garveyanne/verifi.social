# Project Overview

Verifi is a powerful web application built on the Ruby on Rails framework that provides a convenient solution for users who want to ensure that their images comply with Instagram's guidelines. With Verifi, you can effortlessly determine if your image will pass Instagram's criteria before posting it on the popular social media platform.

Using an intuitive and user-friendly interface, Verifi utilizes an advanced Image API to analyze your image and generate a comprehensive report regarding its compliance with Instagram's guidelines. This saves you the frustration of having your image rejected or flagged by Instagram due to violations, helping you maintain a consistent presence and avoid potential penalties or account limitations.
